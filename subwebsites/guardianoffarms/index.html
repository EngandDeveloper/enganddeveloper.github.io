        <h3 class="title-2">About The Project</h3>
        <p> I developed this game using Unity 2D Game Engine in C#. I have learned how to use Unity and C# from scratch by reading a lot of documentation
            and using my existing Java knowledge. It took me about a month to finish the initial version. Ever since, I am maintaning the app by publishing new updates.
            Updates include more optimized code for performance optimizations, bug fixes, and new features as well as improved UI based on the user feedback to provide the
            best user exeperience possible.
        </p>
