Personal Resume/Blog/Site

I will host my personal projects through GitHub. This way, anyone who is interested in learning the code behind my projects
not only will access the projects but also can download and see the source codes.

In the main branch, index.html is the html file for the landing page. If you are interested in a specific project please go
to the subsites folder and find the project file.
